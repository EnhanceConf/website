Hey Ben, 

This is just the basic copy and markup.

You welcome to delete everything in style.css, it was just so I could make it reasonably presentable.

Feel free to change copy if you think it can be improved. 

If you see any .nw classes thats just to remind me that the wording needs work.

Ive added some links at the bottom of this file to some nice conference sites but feel free to ignore those if you have better ideas.


Any questions give me a shout. Happy to buy graphics and fonts where needed.

Thanks very much. 

#Requirements:

Must work with js turned off :)

Google maps doesnt need to.

In the main nav the tickets link should have a way (probably a class) to highlight when tickets are available >>buy now<<

css3 selectors have fallbacks. (or a todo)

We need to take the styles used on this site and use them for the Sponsors pdf. Souldn't be a problem, just mentioning it.
