    h1 About


    p Supporting the devices of 3 billion people can seem daunting. We believe progressive enhancement gives a massive advantage and remains an important aspect in pushing the boundaries of the web.

            p “After attending a number of conferences showcasing the latest frameworks I felt something was missing. 

            p I wanted a conference covering the state of the art in progressive enhancement; focussing on techniques that provide the best experience to the widest possible audience.” - 
                i Simon McManus, Organiser

    p Topics we want to cover include:

    ul
        include _topics.jade

    p We may dive into a particular language, library or framework but the focus will be on techniques rather than specific implementations.

    p EnhanceConf will be a community event, any extra money from ticket sales will be put back into the event.
