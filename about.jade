p We&apos;re convinced that progressive enhancement remains an important aspect in pushing the boundaries while still providing a robust experience for every user.

p This is not just about apps that require javascript but rather a conference about providing the best possible experience to the widest possible audience. Regardless of technology.

p We wanted a conference covering the state of the art in progressive enhancement. Bringing different communities together. Somewhere to learn from one another and become greater than the sum of our parts.


p Enhance Conf is that conference, regardless of your language or framework preference we think you have something to contribute. Audience participation will be an important aspect of this event.
